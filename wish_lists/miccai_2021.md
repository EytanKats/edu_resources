# Papers to dive in from MICCAI 2021

___

### Self-supervised Visual Representation Learning for Histopathological Images
Yang et al.

This paper proposes **self-supervised** pretraining method for histopathological images.
Augmentation-based **contrastive learning** adopted for self-supervision 
while pretrained generative model used as a regularizer to prevent encoder collapse.

___

### TransPath: Transformer-Based Self-supervised Learning for Histopathological Image Classification
Wang et al.

This paper proposes **self-supervised** pretraining method for histopathological images.
Hybrid architecture consisting of convolutional and **transformer** parts is used to capture both local and global features.
Augmentation-based **contrastive learning** adopted for self-supervision
while two parallel paths shares a similar structure but different network weights.

___

### Self-Supervised Longitudinal Neighbourhood Embedding
Ouyang et al.

This paper proposes **self-supervised** pretraining method for longitudinal brain MRIs.
Very interesting technique of matching latent vectors directions (of different subjects) is used **to shape latent space**.
As a result, **the latent space encodes the global morphological change** linked to aging.
