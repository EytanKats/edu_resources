### Self-supervised Visual Representation Learning for Histopathological Images
Yang et al.

This paper proposes **self-supervised** pretraining method for histopathological images.
Augmentation-based **contrastive learning** adopted for self-supervision 
while pretrained generative model used as a regularizer to prevent encoder collapse.
