**Main contribution**  
- 3D Region Proposal Network (RPN) to simultaneously detect and classify breast lesions in Automated Breast Ultrasound (ABUS) images.
- Intersection-over-Union (IoU) balanced classification loss to enlarge contribution of detections with good regression to learning process comparing to those with bad regression.
- Similarity loss between feature vectors corresponding to detections to increase intra-category correlation and inter-category discrimination.
